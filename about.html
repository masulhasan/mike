  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h2 class="selectable">
    We are more than just a business; we are a father and son, a family united by a shared passion for craftsmanship. In 2012, our company was born from the vision of embarking on our first joint project, allowing Graham to pass on his wealth of knowledge and experience through the art of converting a barn.
Since those beginnings, we've journeyed together, expanding our horizons to encompass numerous conversions, extensions, and renovations. Yet, no matter how far we venture, we remain firmly rooted in our heritage of traditional carpentry and joinery. It's where our heart lies, and it's the foundation of our enduring commitment to craftsmanship.
